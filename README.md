# Development of a Cart-Mounted Inverted Pendulum Test Bench

## Project Description
This repository contains the report for the design and development of a **cart-mounted inverted pendulum test bench**, created as an undergraduate thesis project by **Sarwan Shah, Muhammad Abdullah Siddiqui, and Adil Ali Khan** at **Habib University** in **2021**. The project aims to offer students an accessible, scalable, and cost-effective platform for learning control system principles and exploring vision-based control strategies.

This system was entirely designed and constructed in-house to facilitate hands-on research and education.

## Key Features
- **Custom-built hardware** platform with a cart-mounted pendulum.
- **MATLAB/Simulink** models for system dynamics and simulation.
- **Real-time feedback** from both rotary encoders and a vision-based tracking system (ZED2 camera).
- **Open-source** design with a low-cost implementation (< $200).
- **Scalable system** for varying levels of control complexity and educational use.

## Project Setup

### Hardware Requirements
- **Custom track and cart** with rotary encoders.
- **DC motor** and timing belt for actuation.
- **Arduino Mega 2560** as the primary microcontroller.
- **ZED2 Stereo Camera** for vision-based tracking.
- Power supply and motor driver (Pololu VNH5019).

### Software Requirements
- **MATLAB/Simulink** for simulations and control.
- **LabVIEW** for data visualization (optional).
- **Arduino IDE** for uploading firmware.
- Python (optional) for vision-processing algorithms.
